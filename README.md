DISPATCHORAMA
=============

This project was inspired by Paul Lewis' coverage of the UK riots and also some of the community outreach activities and happening at the Guardian, in particular the idea of a widely distributed story or one that evolves and changes location.

Dispatch-o-rama uses the n0tice API (http://n0tice.org), JQuery Mobile, and Google Maps APIs.  I'm also trying to get some useful info out of other feeds, including twitter.

I've written about the project here:
